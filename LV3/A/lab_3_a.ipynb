    "# Laboratory Exercise: Click-Through Rate (CTR) Prediction for Ad Placements\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this laboratory exercise, you will build a **binary classification model** that predicts whether a given **ad placement on a webpage will be clicked or not**. Each example in the dataset represents a single ad impression with a set of features describing the context of the placement (e.g. page, position, user and ad attributes). The target variable is a binary label indicating whether the ad was clicked.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Task:** Binary classification\n",
    "- **Target column:** `is_click`\n",
    "- **Goal:** Predict whether an ad placement will be clicked (`1`) or not (`0`)\n",
    "\n",
    "You will work with a provided dataset (`dataset.csv`) and implement a complete **machine learning training pipeline** using PyTorch.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tasks Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "You are required to implement the following components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Preparation**\n",
    "   - Load the `dataset.csv` file\n",
    "   - Separate features from the target column `is_click`\n",
    "   - Split the data into training, validation, and test sets\n",
    "   - Apply any required preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Dataset Class**\n",
    "   - Implement an `AdsDataset` class compatible with PyTorch’s `DataLoader`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Model Building**\n",
    "   - Implement a `build_model` function that returns a neural network for binary classification\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Training and Evaluation**\n",
    "   - Implement:\n",
    "     - `train_one_epoch`\n",
    "     - `evaluate`\n",
    "     - `test`\n",
    "   - Train the model for a fixed number of epochs\n",
    "   - Track training loss, validation loss, and validation accuracy for each epoch\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Visualization**\n",
    "   - Plot:\n",
    "     - Training loss vs. epochs\n",
    "     - Validation loss vs. epochs\n",
    "     - Validation accuracy vs. epochs\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Testing and Reporting**\n",
    "   - Evaluate the final model on the test dataset\n",
    "   - Generate a **classification report** (precision, recall, F1-score)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Comparison Requirement\n",
    "\n",
    "You must design and train **two different model configurations**, for example:\n",
    "- Different network depths or widths\n",
    "- Different activation functions\n",
    "- Different regularization strategies (e.g. dropout)\n",
    "\n",
    "For **each model**, you must:\n",
    "- Train it for the same number of epochs\n",
    "- Plot training and validation metrics\n",
    "- Evaluate it on the test set\n",
    "\n",
    "# ⚠️ **Performance Constraint:**\n",
    "\n",
    "At least **one of your models must achieve a minimum F1-score of 66% for *both* classes** on the test dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Reaching this performance level will **not be possible by blindly training a model with default settings**. You are expected to **carefully examine the properties of the dataset** and recall a key concept discussed in class that can significantly affect the performance of binary classifiers in real-world scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "Identifying and addressing this issue is an **essential part of the exercise** and will be reflected in the final evaluation.\n"
